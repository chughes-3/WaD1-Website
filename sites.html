        Clark County Free Tax Preparation Locations
      </h3>
      <p>
        The map below shows the locations where free tax returns are prepared. The map is centered on the greater <a href="#" onclick="centervc();">Vancouver Map</a> area. Moving the mouse to the site markers will give information about the site and clicking on the marker will take you to even more information about the site. The information about site locations is also presented in tabular form for the <a href="#VancLocs">Vancouver Area</a> 
      </p>
      <div id="map_canvas"></div>
      <p>
        <b>Tax returns</b> are prepared on a computer using IRS provided tax software and then e-filed. We give our clients a printed copy of the e-filed return. This saves having to mail a copy to the IRS. We can also have the refund electronically deposited into up to three separate accounts, or have the payment due deducted electronically from your bank account (on a date you select). We do not routinely prepare paper returns. We only prepare paper returns (still using the computer) in rare situations, generally when required by the IRS (for example, an amended return). If an Oregon return is required, we will also prepare and e-file it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our sites are only open between Feb 1st and the end of the filing season (April 17th for the 2011 tax year). The days and hours of operation will become available in January. Generally speaking all of our Tax-Aide sites are very busy the first 2-4 weeks; it is not unusual to have more people waiting for service than we can handle when we open for business and we have to turn people away immediately. The sites generally become somewhat less busy the later part of February and during March. In April activity picks up again as people rush to beat the April 15 deadline. If you can avoid the busy times it would help both you and us.

        <a id="MainLib"></a><b>Vancouver Community Library (Main Library), 901 C Street, Vancouver
This site has moved from the previous location along with the library itself and is now on C Street. </b><br />
        Located on the corner of East Mill Plain Boulevard and Fort Vancouver Way (just east of I-5 and near the Clark College campus). This is our busiest and also our largest site. Note that it is open 
          three days per week, and that one of those days has an extended shift. Even though we have the most tax counselors at the Library, most of the time you should expect a long wait. If you arrive late in a shift you likely will not be served that day.

        Located on E McLoughlin Boulevard just east of I-5 and west of Ft Vancouver Way and Clark College. This site is very popular and well staffed, but is also very busy most of tax season. You should expect a wait or to be turned away if you arrive late. One reason for its popularity is that it used to be open five days per week; it now is open only two days/week.

In the past this site has been open 3-5 days and been very busy for most of tax season.  It has become a very popular site for seniors and others using the Community Center or Meals on Wheels site and for people living in East Vancouver.  Note that this year it is only open two days/week.
