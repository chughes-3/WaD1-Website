        Clark and Cowlitz County Free Tax Preparation Locations

        The map below shows the locations where free tax returns are prepared. The map can be centered on the greater <a href="#" onclick="centervc();">Vancouver Map</a> area or on the <a href="#" onclick="centerlong();">Longview Map</a> area. Moving the mouse to the site markers will give information about the site and clicking on the marker will take you to even more information about the site.

      <p>
        <b>Tax returns</b> are prepared on a computer using IRS provided tax software and then e-filed. We give our clients a printed copy of the e-filed return. This saves having to mail a copy to the IRS. We can also have the refund electronically deposited into up to three separate accounts, or have the payment due deducted electronically from your bank account (on a date you select). We do not routinely prepare paper returns. We only prepare paper returns (still using the computer) in rare situations, generally when required by the IRS (for example, an amended return). If an Oregon return is required, we will also prepare and e-file it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our sites are only open between Feb 1st and the end of the filing season (typically April 15th). The days and hours of operation will become available in January. Generally speaking all of our Tax-Aide sites are very busy the first 2-4 weeks; it is not unusual to have more people waiting for service than we can handle when we open for business and we have to turn people away immediately. The sites generally become somewhat less busy the later part of February and during March. In April activity picks up again as people rush to beat the April 15 deadline. If you can avoid the busy times it would help both you and us.

        <a id="MainLib"></a><b>Vancouver Community Library (Main Library), 1007 E Mill Plain Blvd, Vancouver</b><br />
        Located on the corner of East Mill Plain Boulevard and Fort Vancouver Way (just east of I-5 and near the Clark College campus). This is our busiest and also our largest site. Note that it is open four days per week, and that two of those days are extended shifts. Even though we have the most tax counselors at the Library, most of the time you should expect a long wait. If you arrive late in a shift you likely will not be served that day.

        <a id="Marshall"></a><b>Marshall Community Center, 1009 E McLoughlin Blvd, Vancouver</b><br />
        Located on E McLoughlin Boulevard just east of I-5 and west of Ft Vancouver Way and Clark College. This site is very popular and well staffed, but is also very busy most of tax season. You should expect a wait or to be turned away if you arrive late. One reason for its popularity is that it used to be open five days per week; it now is open only two days/week. More information is here <a href="#VancLocs">site schedule</a> and here <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=Marshall+Community+Center,+1009+E+McLoughlin+Blvd,+Vancouver&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=Marshall+Community+Center,&amp;hnear=1009+E+McLoughlin+Blvd,+Vancouver&amp;cid=0,0,10622640199170928140&amp;ei=MHrDSqyOPIayswP9_JXJAg&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">driving directions</a>

        Located on 136th Ave between NE Mill Plain Blvd and NE 18th St, and a little over one mile east of I-205.  In the past this site has been open 3-5 days and been very busy for most of tax season.  It has become a very popular site for seniors and others using the Community Center or Meals on Wheels site and for people living in East Vancouver.  Note that this year it is only open two days/week.

       Centrally located and easily located in Camas, this is a popular site for people living in Camas, Washougal, and East Clark County.  It, too, tends to be a very busy site all year long and has traditionally operated two or three days per week.  This year it will be open four days per week, which should help relieve some of the waiting times and accommodate more clients. More information is here <a href="#VancLocs">site schedule</a> and here <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=Camas+Public+Library,+625+NE+4th+Ave,+Camas&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=Camas+Public+Library,&amp;hnear=625+NE+4th+Ave,+Camas&amp;cid=0,0,16274859734843663170&amp;ei=3XfDSrmBHo_usQOSueTUAg&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">driving directions</a>

        Located just northwest of Westfield Vancouver Mall, near the Thurston Rd exit off SR500, this site is somewhat secluded but easily accessible.  This has traditionally been one of our less-busy sites, especially after the early February rush.  However it is growing in popularity as overflow clients from busier sites are referred to Glenwood and then return in following years.  We have expanded the number of tax preparers at this site from 2 to 3, and can handle additional workload, particularly late in the tax season.  Our evening shifts are usually less busy too.
