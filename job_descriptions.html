Each position utilizes different skills, but all are challenging, rewarding, and essential to the AARP Tax-Aide program&#39;s success. Descriptions of the many positions available to volunteers are below.</p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Counselors: </span>Counselors are volunteers, trained and certified using the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) training materials, who work directly with persons who need assistance in preparing their tax returns. To qualify as a Counselor, an individual should have an interest in tax work, experience in filing their own returns, ability to learn and use moderately complex computer software, and a willingness to make a significant commitment of time and effort toward training and then work. A minimum work commitment of 40 hours from February 1 until April 15 (one four-hour shift per week at a site for 10 weeks) is required, however most Counselors work more shifts and therefore more hours. We strongly recommend that new counselors work at least two shifts per week in order to better hone the skills learned in training.  New Counselors are required to complete attend an extensive course of training beginning with IRS-provided text books and practice returns in December, followed by formal classroom training applying tax law and using computer-based tax software in January. All counselors must also successfully complete the IRS open-book certification test annually. course to become knowledgeable about the filing requirements and other aspects of the tax returns of older people. After the first year the training load is less intense and generally consists of refresher training in tax law and the computer software, and introduction to new/changed tax law. Once trained and IRS certified, Volunteer counselors are trained to assist older persons with their federal as well as their state and local returnstax returns for TaxAide clients. Though the program focuses on preparing the personal income taxes of middle and low income taxpayers with special attention to those age 60 and older, Counselors assist a wide variety of taxpayers.  as a service to those who are unable to afford professional assistance.  Counselors are also the program&#8217;s most important recruiters and proponents in the community, and are requested to help recruit new volunteers to the program. Counselors with technical and/or leadership skills are encouraged to consider volunteering for a position where these skills can also be utilized to the benefit of the program.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Client Facilitators (CF):  </span>A good CF is often they key to an efficiently run Tax-Aide site. The CF works closely with the LC and performs receptionist-type duties at the site. The CF is not required to complete the tax law and computer based tax training or to obtain IRS certification; however they must sign the IRS Confidentiality Agreement (like all other volunteers). The CF greets clients as they arrive, signs them in and advises them of an approximate wait time, and checks to be sure they have the basic information required for TaxAide to complete their tax return. They may have to turn some people away because they did not bring all the correct information or because they cannot be served that day. They also hand out the Intake and Interview Sheet and answer basic questions about it not requiring knowledge of tax law. The CF also makes sure the sign in sheet is completed by the counselors as returns are completed. The basic qualifications for CF are that they enjoy working with the public and are organized and personable. Annual training is also provided for CFs on policies and any changes to the operational aspects of the sites.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Shift Coordinator (SCO): </span>This is a new position, created to assist the LC in managing the operation of his/her sites. The SCO works for the LC, acting as the &#8220;person in charge&#8221; of the site in the absence of the LC. The SCO will usually perform these duties on a regular basis for one or more specific shifts each week. The SCO has the same supervisory authority and operational responsibilities as the LC, as directed by the LC, when working on the LC&#8217;s behalf.  The SCO is generally a more experienced Counselor who is willing to take on the added responsibilities. EROs may fill this position at some sites. This is also an excellent upward mobility position for a Counselor wishing to move up to an LC position.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Local Coordinator (LC): </span>The LC is responsible for operation of one or more sites. The LC supervises all volunteers who work at their site and insure that policies and procedures are followed in the preparation of tax returns. They also are responsible for the security of taxpayer data at their site. LCs also make sure necessary forms, publications, and administrative material are available to the volunteers at their sites, collect and report data regarding the returns completed, and are responsible for the physical security of equipment allocated to their site. They also work closely with their site owner/contact for scheduling and availability of site resources.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Electronic Return Originators (ERO): </span>The EROs provide a vital link in the e-filing process. Their primary responsibility is the gathering of completed federal and state returns from their assigned site(s), insuring the returns are ready for transmittal to the IRS, and then transmitting them. If a return rejects, a specific cause is noted, and the ERO is responsible for insuring correction of the return, either by use of available information, direct contact with the taxpayer, or referring the return back to the site for correction. The ERO insures all rejects are resolved. For specific returns requiring it, the ERO mails copies of specified documents to the IRS upon acceptance of the e-filed return. The ERO also stores copies of tax documents for all e-filed returns, as required by the IRS until the end of tax season, at which time they are mailed to the Seattle IRS office. EROs often serve as Assistant TCs because of the overlap in knowledge required for each position &#8211; one example is they are generally responsible for installing software updates on computers at their site. The ERO works for and closely with the site LC but is responsive to the TC on technical matters, and generally takes direction on ERO-specific duties from the TC.
      </p>
	<p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Tax-Aide District level Positions</span><br />To complete the picture of the Tax-Aide district organization the District level positions are described below. These positions are normally filled by people who have experience in volunteer level positions. 
	</p>      
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">District Coordinator (DC): </span>The DC is the &#34;top level&#34; person responsible for the overall operation of the Tax-Aide Program in a designated district within a state (for example: District 1 and District 23 cover four counties in SW Washington). The DC formulates and implements plans and goals for the district, in line with those set by the State and National organizations, is responsible for all activities within their District, and directly leads and supervises the District Management Team. The DC recruits and appoints individuals to other Leadership positions, and oversees recruiting and training of all volunteers. The DC works with both state and district staff to carry out the activities of the district.
      </p>
	<p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Administrative Coordinator (AC): </span>The AC is responsible for coordinating and managing all administrative duties in the District, as assigned by the DC. The AC works closely with the DC and other leadership to insure that administrative reports and rosters are kept current. The AC provides updates to TaxAide personnel and site rosters to the State Administrative Specialist (ADS) and keeps local rosters and schedules as requested by the DC. The AC also assists other volunteers with preparing correct expense reports and provides training as necessary. The AC performs other administrative duties for the District as assigned by the DC.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Technology Coordinator (TC): </span>The TC works with the DC and the State Technology Specialist to implement and maintain computer-based systems for training and tax preparation. The TC receives allocated computers from the IRS and, working closely with the DC and LCs, determines how best to utilize them in conjunction with other computers available to the district. The TC is responsible for ordering the IRS software used in the preparation of tax returns. The TC determines the best configuration of computers and printers in a network to support each site based on site configuration and specific needs. The TC either configures the computers for the site network or oversees configuration by EROs and assistant TCs. The TC trains and oversees the work of the EROs. The TC provides technical support to the sites either personally or via EROs and Assistant TCs to ensure their reliable operation. At the end of tax season the TC insures all taxpayer data is removed from the computers, ships IRS computers back to the depot, and arranges storage for district-owned equipment.
      </p>
      <p>NOTE:  Although not official positions or part of the district leadership team, individuals with technical skills are encouraged to volunteer to be assistant TCs. We would like to have a technically trained person assigned to each site, and preferably to each shift. In some cases the ERO or LC perform this function, but in other cases volunteers are trained with the necessary skills. Assistant TCs report to the TC when filling this role.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Training Coordinator (TRC): </span>The TRC is responsible for all counselor training conducted in the district. The TRC recruits, trains, and supervises instructors who perform the actual training. The TRC evaluates the needs of district counselors and develops the training curriculum for the district in conjunction with the DC and other Leadership Team members based on the specific training needs identified for both returning and new district volunteers. The TRC tracks changes in tax law, and with the assistance of the TC changes in the IRS software affecting the program, and ensures they are included in the training program. In District 1 the TRC is also responsible for integrating training in Oregon Tax Law and Tax Return preparation into the overall training program. The TRC evaluates the effectiveness of the individual Instructors and assists them in improving teaching techniques or class content when required. The TRC recommends retention or non-retention of Instructors to the DC before the beginning of the training cycle each year.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Communications Coordinator (CC): </span>The CC works with the DC and LCs to implement program publicity and communication at the district and local level. At the discretion of the DC, the CC may also coordinate and assist in implementing partnerships. The CC builds and maintains a file of local media and other publicity contacts (e.g. activity directors at retirement centers). The CC develops publicity for distribution to these contacts, often based on the particular target audience and district needs such as recruitment of volunteers in the fall and advertising site availability/hours in January. The CC may receive some boilerplate publicity materials from the national office or his/her state counterpart which then must be customized to include pertinent district facts and requirements.
      </p>
      <p>The following positions are not part of the District Leadership Team, though their input as to the operation and functioning of the district are always welcome. In all cases they report to a member of the Leadership Team and are encouraged to offer their suggestions through the reporting chain. 
      </p>
            <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Instructors (INS): </span>The INS report to the TRC. They are responsible for developing training materials/classes and conducting training sessions for volunteers covering income-tax law and its application through preparation of computer-based tax returns, within the scope of the program (click here (link) for the program scope &#8211; maybe?). Much of the training is conducted using computers and IRS software. Training guidance and some material are provided by the IRS and TaxAide but they generally require modification to meet local requirements. Instructors also follow the guidance and direction of the DC &amp; TCS as to local training needs. Instructors are selected for their knowledge of tax law and return preparation and for their training skills.
