	  <h2>TRAINING
	  </h2>
	  <p>Thorough training is provided for all AARP Tax-Aide volunteers. This varies from a half day to as many as five days or more, depending upon the volunteer&#39;s experience and the position for which they are being trained
    </p>
		<p><span class="Normaltxtbld">IN BRIEF</span>: Volunteers who prepare tax returns are required to complete an advanced level of training and certification on tax law based on IRS training and testing material.  Volunteers who only fill administrative or support roles receive a reduced level of training and do not have to certify on tax law.  All volunteers in the program are required to sign an IRS Confidentiality Agreement.
		</p>
    <p>Returning counselors or people with prior Tax-Aide tax preparation certification and experience are required to attend a refresher course and complete all certification tests.
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">ORIENTATION</span> provides an overview of the program and the various volunteer roles in the organization. A background on the organization itself is also featured during the two hour program. Samples of the training materials are reviewed to enable each prospective volunteer to gain an understanding of the time commitment required and of the study materials used to prepare for IRS certification testing. An orientation meeting is held in the fall of each year. Each new volunteer is expected to attend this session.
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">NEW COUNSELOR</span> candidates receive their IRS study and test materials in late November or early December and are expected to study the material prior to their formal class training in January. New Counselors are also encouraged to complete as much of the certification test as they can before formal training classes (the test will be turned in and during or at the end of class. Successful completion of the practice tax returns on a computer in class will also result in e-file certification.
    </p>
    <p>Formal classes are held for approximately five consecutive days in January and attendance is necessary for a complete understanding of the materials. The Oregon State materials are distributed at the beginning of this class session and the completion of Oregon returns is covered during this class session. Classes are held in the Vancouver and Longview areas. These classes are followed by additional practice time with the computer software and many example tax return situations.
    </p>
    <p>The IRS VITA/TCE test is an &#8220;open book&#8221; test. A passing score is required; retests may be administered in cases of individual need. Volunteers are then certified as counselors and serve at one or more of the various sites in the Clark or Cowlitz County area, based on where they live. A minimum of 40 hours counseling is required of all counselors and most will complete this requirement working 2 or more four hour shifts at one or more sites during the 10-11 week tax season.
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">EXPERIENCED COUNSELORS</span> attend an abbreviated class each year to review the updated IRS and Oregon tax materials and complete the current year&#39;s IRS tests for certification. New tax law changes and software changes are also covered in this class.
    </p>
    <p>All training and practice return preparation will be done using computers and TaxWise&reg; tax preparation software in order to familiarize the counselor with the software and its capabilities while concurrently applying their new knowledge of tax law changes. 
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">CLIENT FACILITATORS</span> receive their training during late January before serving at one or more of the sites. Like counselors, they too serve a minimum of 40 hours during the tax season and most will assist at a couple of sites each week. Persons serving in this role assist taxpayers in the preparation of their intake information forms and assist with a variety of administrative duties.
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">LEADERSHIP</span> positions for <b>District Coordinator</b> (DC), <b>Local Coordinator</b> (LC), <b>Technology Coordinator</b> (TC), <b>Training Coordinators</b> (TrC),  <b>Instructors</b> (INS),  <b>Electronic Return Originator</b> (ERO), and <b>Communications Coordinator</b> (CC) all require prior experience as a counselor and additional training pertinent to that position. This training will often be with other Leadership people from across Washington State and will often include on the job training. If you are interested in one of these positions contact your LC or DC.
