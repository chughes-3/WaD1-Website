		<p><span class="Normaltxtbld">What is AARP Tax-Aide?</span><br />A free, quality income tax assistance and income tax return preparation service which operates under the umbrella of the AARP Foundation, the charitable arm of AARP.&nbsp;Funding for the Tax-Aide program comes from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the AARP Foundation, and private contributions.
		</p>
      <p>Aimed, in general, at low- and middle-income taxpayers with special attention to those 60 and older.&nbsp;However, as a matter of practice, our Tax-Aide sites provide  free income tax assistance and income tax return preparation for most low- to middle-income taxpayers.
      </p>
      <p>Tax-Aide sites are staffed with friendly local volunteers trained using IRS training materials specifically developed for Tax-Aide.&nbsp;Training includes tax law and preparation of simulated income tax returns, including the tax forms and schedules used by most individual taxpayers.&nbsp;The volunteer income tax preparers are then certified with an IRS examination administered each year.
      </p>
      <p>Available for on-site tax assistance locally at approximately 10 sites staffed by approximately 80 volunteers, between February 1 and April 15.
      </p>
      <p>Year-round online tax assistance is available at <a href="www.aarp.org/taxaide">www.aarp.org/taxaide</a>.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">How do we operate?</span><br />We use a standardized process to prepare tax returns. You will be asked to complete a form that provides the basic information. The Counselor will review the form and your tax documents (W-2&#39;s, 1099&#39;s, etc) with you as the first step. 
      </p>
      <p>If the return is within the scope of the program (and most are), the Counselor will complete your tax return using professional-grade income tax preparation software furnished by the IRS. The Counselor will probably have questions for you during this process.
      </p>
      <p>Once your income tax return is completed, it will be checked for accuracy and completeness by another Counselor - our Quality Review. Our goal is 100% accuracy in your tax return.
      </p>
      <p>Your return will be electronically filed with the IRS and, if necessary, with the State of Oregon. In some rare situations we will printout a return to be stamped and  mailed. 
      </p>
      <p>Tax-Aide sites are staffed with friendly local volunteers trained using IRS training materials specifically developed for Tax-Aide.&nbsp;Training includes tax law and preparation of simulated income tax returns, including the tax forms and schedules used by most individual taxpayers.&nbsp;The volunteer income tax preparers are certified with an IRS examination administered each year.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Where do we operate?</span><br />Nationally, AARP Tax-Aide provides tax return preparation and tax counseling at nearly 6,500 sites, using over 35,300 volunteers.&nbsp;For the 2009 tax season Tax Aide helped over 2.6 million customers nationally.&nbsp;The program is administered through a small staff at the National office in Washington DC, through volunteer Regional, State, and District, and Local (site) coordinators.&nbsp;There are also a number of volunteer staffed committees focused on issues like technology and training.
      </p>
      <p>Washington Tax-Aide District 1 is assigned four counties in SW Washington State:  Clark, Cowlitz, Skamania, and Wahkiakum.&nbsp;There are 
          seven full-time tax preparation sites in <a href="sites.html">Clark County</a> and three full-time tax preparation sites in <a href="sites.html">Cowlitz County</a>.&nbsp;Sites operate from one to 
          three days per week.
      </p>
      <p>Tax-Aide prepares income tax forms and provides tax assistance in sites generously provided by a variety of site owners, such as public libraries, recreation centers, senior centers, and retirement communities.&nbsp;Since the AARP Foundation, the umbrella organization for the Tax-Aide program, is an IRS <a href="http://assets.aarp.org/www.aarp.org_/articles/taxaide/extranet/501c3Letter.pdf">certified 501(c)(3) charitable organization</a>, privately owned site-providers can generally write off the in-kind value of the site as a charitable contribution.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">How can I be a part of this program?</span><br />You must sign an IRS Confidentiality Statement, which basically says you will not reveal personal or income tax-related information about anyone assisted by the program. 
      </p>
      <p>You must successfully complete the required <a href="training.html">training</a> for the position for which you are volunteering
      </p>
      <p>You must work a minimum number of hours preparing tax returns or performing other duties during tax season.
      </p>
      <p>To volunteer you should complete the <a href="http://www.aarp.org/aarp/articles/Volunteer_with_AARP_Tax_Aide.html">Volunteer Contact Form</a>, or call the AARP Tax-Aide toll-free number, 1-800-AARPNOW (1-888-227-7669); or contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:voltaxaide@comcast.net">voltaxaide@comcast.net</a>.
