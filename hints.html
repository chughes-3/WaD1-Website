	 <h2>New Credits for 2009</h2>
		<p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Home Energy Efficiency Improvements</span><br />This credit provides for a uniform credit of 30 percent of the cost of qualifying improvements up to $1,500. A similarly named credit existed in previous years but this year’s version is more generous. The new provisions were part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Additional information can be found <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=206875,00.html">here</a>
		</p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Making Work Pay Tax Credit</span><br />This credit &ndash;&ndash; available for tax years 2009 and 2010 -- equals 6.2 percent of a taxpayer’s earned income subject to certain limitations. It is being implemented by changing the employer withholding tables. The taxpayer does not have to do anything to benefit from this credit, unless they wish to change their withholding allowances to have more tax withheld.
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">First-Time Homebuyer Credit</span><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded the first-time homebuyer credit by increasing the credit amount to $8,000 for purchases made in 2009 before Dec. 1. First-time homebuyers who purchase a home in 2009 can claim the credit on either a 2008 tax return, due April 15, 2009, or a 2009 tax return, due April 15, 2010. The credit may not be claimed before the closing date. More information is available <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=205416,00.html">here</a>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Education Credits</span><br />The Hope Credit which is often used by students or their families is expanded in value and duration. More information is available <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=205674,00.html">here</a>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">New Vehicle Taxes</span><br />Deducting state sales and excise taxes as an itemized deduction has been available for the last few years. Now this deduction is available to people who do not itemize on their tax returns. More information is available <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=209624,00.html">here</a>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Property Taxes Deductible for Tax year 2009</span><br />Real Estate taxes (Property taxes) continue to be deductible for tax year 2009 (with limitations). This is true even if you do not itemize deductions on your tax return. You will need to bring evidence of paid property taxes in the form of a cancelled check or a property tax statement.
