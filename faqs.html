      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Can anyone get tax preparation help at an AARP Tax-Aide site?</span><br />Almost anyone can receive free assistance, as long as the tax return does not exceed the scope of the program as outlined by the IRS and AARP. We cover many areas of the tax code that apply to our clients but an example of something that we do not do is married filing separate returns. We file only individual income tax returns returns using IRS Form 1040.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">May I make an appointment?</span><br />Taxpayers are 
          generally served on a first-come, first-serve basis except that in busy times, 
          preference will be given to seniors over age 60 on request and those whose 
          health may limit their ability to wait in long lines.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Is it really free &#8211; even the e-filing of a return?</span><br />Yes, there is no charge; tips and gratuities are not solicited nor accepted at the site.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Can I make a contribution for services rendered</span><br />Contributions are not required for service, and we do not in any way solicit them. However, if a taxpayer still would like to make a contribution then it must be made to the &#8220;AARP Foundation Tax-Aide&#8221; and we would ask that you include: &#8220;For the benefit of AARP Tax-Aide Washington District 1&#8221; on the lower left of the check. The contributions should be sent to AARP Foundation, ATTN: AARP Tax-Aide Program, 601 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20049. Ask your Tax-Aide tax preparer for a form that can be sent with your contribution so it is credited to our local program.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Do both spouses need to be present?</span><br />Electronic returns using Form 8879 must be signed and the form may be taken home and signed by the spouse and returned to the site if both are not present. In this case the return cannot be e-filed until the signed form is returned to the Tax-Aide site
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">What forms can be prepared?</span><br />

      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">How about information from a K-1?</span><br />Returns may include information from simple K-1&#8217;s that contain interest, dividends, 
          and Royalties. Those with depreciation and complex issues should be handled by a paid professional.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Are state returns prepared?</span><br />Oregon Resident, Non-Resident, Partial Year Resident returns can be prepared and e-filed in conjunction with the Federal Tax Return.&nbsp;No other State tax returns are prepared
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Can you prepare returns for people with ITINs?</span><br />Yes, in most cases we can prepare tax returns for taxpayers with ITINs. You must show us a copy of the original document assigning the ITIN for everyone on the return with one. We can also prepare the paper return required to obtain an ITIN, though you must obtain the Form W-7 that has to accompany it from the IRS or another source.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Can you  prepare  prior year returns?</span><br />Yes, we can usually prepare prior year Federal and Oregon returns for the past 3 years, though they cannot be e-filed. You must bring all of the same documentation that is required for a current year return.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">If I arrive before closing time, will my return be completed?</span><br />New returns are generally not started during the last hour listed for the site.&nbsp;Upon arrival, the client facilitator will advise persons of the likelihood of being served that day.&nbsp;Taxpayers may be referred to another site and/or advised to return on a different day if it appears service cannot be provided that day.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">Does the taxpayer need to complete any forms?</span><br />Yes, each taxpayer is required to complete the<b> &#8220;AARP Tax-Aide INTERVIEW AND INTAKE SHEET&#8221;</b> before the return can be started &#8211; this form is provided at the site.&nbsp;If necessary, assistance in the preparation of this form is available from the Client Facilitators and Counselors.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Normaltxtbld">How do I know you will prepare my return correctly?</span><br />All counselors are required to attend tax training classes which include both Federal and Oregon tax return preparation. All counselors are required to pass an IRS certification test annually which establishes proficiency and performance with regard to preparing tax returns within the scope of the program. Counselors also must show proficiency in use of the tax preparation software used at our sites as well as knowledge and application of Oregon tax law.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, once the tax counselor completes a return another certified counselor will be asked to perform a Quality Review of the return. The Quality Reviewer confirms that the preparing counselor has done the return correctly and completely, and corrects any errors if found. In addition, every site is staffed with experienced counselors who assist each other on difficult returns or tax law questions. Our focus is always on filing accurate and quality returns.
