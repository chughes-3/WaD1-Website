     <h2><b>WHAT TO DO WITH THAT BIG TAX REFUND?</b></h2>
      <p >You’re getting a nice refund on your tax return and probably already have it spent. Before you do, I hope that you will consider the services that are offered at the <a href="www.homecen.org">Community Housing Resource Center</a> (CHRC). This nonprofit organization is a Tax-Aide program partner and one of 14 tax preparation sites in the AARP SW Washington Taxaide program.
      </p>
      <p ><img class="right" src="Assets/imgs/chrc_kh_sp.JPG" alt="Community Housing Resource Center Entrance" />
Why not direct deposit your refund into a savings account until you have given yourself the opportunity to explore home ownership or work on resolving credit and debt issues.  This may sound like a dream beyond your expectations, but you might be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>The CHRC offers numerous programs that may help you realize a dream you never thought could happen.  Do yourself a favor and attend a “Get the Facts” workshop, CreditSmart®, a financial education class, or a first-time homebuyer class.   The Center also provides counseling services for credit repair, debt management, budget counseling, reverse mortgages, and mortgage default counseling. All classes are free and there is a $50 charge for the one-on-one counseling services.  The cost includes your credit report.
      </p>
      <p>The first step is to make an appointment to have your tax return completed by a Tax-Aide counselor. They will complete the return, electronically file it, give you a printed copy of the return for your records <img class="left" src="Assets/imgs/chrcoff.JPG" alt="CHRC Office Tax Preparation" />and have your refund electronically deposited into your checking or savings account <span class="Normaltxtbld">all free of charge</span>. While you are at the Center sign up for the 90 minute “Get the Facts” educational workshop intended to dispel the common misconceptions about buying a home, credit and managing money.
     </p>
     <p>The CHRC Tax-Aide tax preparation site is a pilot project, and the only SW Washingtion Tax-Aide site requiring appointments. The site has three IRS certified tax preparers who volunteer four hours a day from 11am until 3pm Monday thru Thursday.
